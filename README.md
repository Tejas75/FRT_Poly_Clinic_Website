### Project Title :
Poly Clinic- Provide affordable healthcare services

### Problem Statement/Opportunity :
Online health websites play a crucial role in providing health information to individuals who might otherwise lack access, such as those living in remote locations or with limited healthcare resources. These platforms bridge the gap for people in underserved areas or with restricted medical facilities.
Convenience is a key advantage of online health websites, allowing people to easily access health information and resources from their homes. This convenience can lead to time and cost savings compared to traditional healthcare services.
Online health websites have the potential to empower individuals by enabling them to manage their own health and make well-informed healthcare choices. This empowerment can result in improved health outcomes and an enhanced quality of life.

### Project Description :
 The Poly Clinic website is thoughtfully designed to cater to medical needs, including hospital supplies, surgical services, clinical laboratory, healthcare bot, oncology, and therapy. It serves as a comprehensive platform for managing patient records and doctor recommendations, streamlining medical requirements.
This website functions as an online healthcare hub, offering a range of services through the internet. These services encompass consultations with medical experts, an online healthcare bot, and access to medical information and resources. These platforms are especially valuable for individuals unable to visit a physical healthcare facility due to geographical or physical limitations. They also suit those who prefer the convenience of receiving healthcare services from their homes.
Furthermore, online healthcare websites can ease the burden on healthcare providers, minimizing patient waiting times. However, it's crucial to remember that these platforms should complement, not replace, in-person medical care, particularly in emergency situations.
